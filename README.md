## Android MVVM Architecture Sample (ViewModel + Dagger Hilt + LiveData + Kotlin + Retrofit) - Weather App

MVVM Architecture is one of the most popular and latest architecture to develop a maintanable and managable codebase. I  have develop a sample `Weater` Android App with `MVVM Architecture` using `Kotlin` language,`Dagger Hilt` for dependency injection,`Coroutine`,`Retrofit` network calling library,`Google Map` and current location fetch form user device.

### Project Description
I have developed a weather Android application using the MVVM architecture. The user interface will resemble the screenshot provided above. The application provides real-time weather updates for the user's current location. It includes a search feature where users can input a city name. Upon selecting a city from the search results, the application sends a request to the OpenWeather web API to fetch and display the weather information in the UI.

### Open Weather API
I have use [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for collecting weather information To get the real weather information of a city also for city search.
